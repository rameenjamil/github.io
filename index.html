  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p>I am creative and always open to learn new things. I am a student at Manchester College and I am studying IT. I love technology and enjoy finding creative solutions to problems. In my free time, I like to cook and bake, making delicious treats for my family. My creativity helps me both in coding and in the kitchen, where I experiments with new recipes. Even though IT can be challenging, I stay motivated because I want to build a bright future for myself and my loved ones. I believe that with hard work and passion, I can achieve my dreams. I am excited to see where my journey takes me and I am looking forward to the many opportunities that lie ahead. </p>
